The New York Times web site provides a rich set of APIs, as described here: http://developer.nytimes.com/docs. We chose the New York Times' Books API, constructed an interface in R to read in the JSON data, and transformed it to an R dataframe.

First, we pull in our data from the API using our API key.

```{r load}
library(RCurl)
key <- "TPSygBadMHg7XTCodHE1xq3eSbQVsgLh"
url <- "https://api.nytimes.com/svc/books/v3/lists/best-sellers/history.json"
pull <- getURL(paste0(url,'?api-key=', key))
pull
```

Next, and finally, we convert our JSON file into a dataframe using the JSONLite package.

```{r }
library(jsonlite)
booksJSON <- fromJSON(pull)[[4]]
typeof(booksJSON)
booksJSON
```
